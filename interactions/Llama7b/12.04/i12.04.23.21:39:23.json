The forest floor is covered in a soft, mossy carpet, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers.\",\n     \"landmarks\": \"A crystal-clear river snakes through the heart of the forest, providing a source of fresh water for the inhabitants.

The Beacon is the source of all light in the Abyss, and it is said that those who gaze upon it will be granted a glimpse into the secrets of the universe. The Beacon is surrounded by a network of caves and tunnels, filled with strange artifacts and mysterious symbols. In the distance, the faint sound of whispers can be heard, the echoes of beings from beyond the stars.\",\n    \"history\": \"The Abyss has been a place of wonder and terror for countless millennia. It is said that the Abyss was born from the void left by the collapse of a great civilization, and that the creatures that dwell within are the remnants of that civilization. The Beacon of the Deep is the last reminder of the civilization that once was, and it is said that the secrets of the universe are hidden within its depths.

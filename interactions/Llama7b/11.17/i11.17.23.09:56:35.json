Always impeccably dressed in her dark hair and gray tweed suits, she exudes quiet confidence and resolve. Astrid is haunted by a tragic accident in her past that took the life of her younger sister and left her with a lifelong fascination with the mysteries of the universe. she has spent countless hours studying the cosmos in pursuit of a greater understanding of what lies beyond our world. A luminous intensity permeates her gaze, and her sharp wit masks a deep sensitivity to the suffering of others.\n2. Zaven Amin - Age 30. Born and raised on the planet Mars, he is a skilled mechanical engineer with broad shoulders, ruggedly muscular physique, and sharp brown eyes. Zaven has a deep, rich voice with accentual clips from his ancestral home. A devout faith in Arachne, the Martian deity of the forge, guides his unwavering dedication to protecting his loved ones and uncovering technological innovations in aviation/aerospace engineering. His impassioned beliefs make him a naturally charismatic leader, capable of inspiration in those who listen to his stirring tales of glory and ambition. With a firm hand and a discerning manner, he takes charge when the situation calls for a capable, driven and intelligent commander. He is a master strategist and knows every weakening of weakpoint of any system that exists on his watch.\n\nBackstories:\nDr. Astrid Flynn\n* Astrid hails from a close-knit family. Her scientist parents imbued her with a boundless curiosity and an unrestricted love for inquiries of the mind and eye. They fostered her love for problem-solving and an understanding of the natural world since the tender age of four years old when she discovered a rock in their backyard with a unique combination of earth minerals and distinctively shaped gems buried in various layers. Astrid found it by accident, strolling out to fetch a pitcher of fresh, capped water from their rainwater collection system but her keen mindsaw at age nine uncovered more.\n* In a devastating earthquake that took her little sister Elara, she found solace in the stars that suddenly seemed like the only constant friend. The Flynns had a deep appreciation for space science during her father's time with the United Systems Military Academy in Jupiter. Astrid spent two lonely evenings, perched in a secret lookout her mum built just high-enough and secure enough to withstand possible tectonic dislocations while the quake ravaged their securest retreat beneath the home they could no longer stand inside, stargazing through her parents' vintage telescope until reality began to dim toward blacklights.\n* Afterwards (the world outside having resigned to normalcy while her people lived through inhumane loss, shock, and mourning), Astrid was taken to her very first formal school outside their humble domicile by a kindly aunt who insisted on helping \"my cute little Astrid... my Elara's twin... get on 'dat good 'pole' in life... to take da world away a bit from my darling wees' pains\" into her mind for herself. In such secludes, she had read every volume from the aged, worn collections she could freely access amidst the ahistoric atmosphere and soon grew fascinated more generally. She could remember it so as to make up mind within these 3 years, 10 months of my birth. So she read fast but studied slow like her father and both tutors insisted, taking courses of mathematics not just as school requirements, for she knew those subjects alone could bring upon her life as much certainty of knowledge about its ways in as many realistic manners necessary to accomplish anything, at a time nearing 60 months past Elara's final moments... as it might in these most tumultuous of days yet untold and unknown ahead in her life. And so reading the histories was an ever lasting companion that led her to where the Flynns once thought their knowledge of tomorrow's world ended to where it actually only began to transcend the reach and reach and teachings of this... Astrid is an educated, trained human now with access to those earliest methods as close as the fingers moving herewith across many millimeters across many millilinks"

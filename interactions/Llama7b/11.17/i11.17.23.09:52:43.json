Zephyr Arcturus - Age: 35 - Occupation: Astrogeologist - Personality: Determined, reserved, and introspective.\n\nBackstory: Zephyr was born on a colonization ship headed towards a distant exoplanet known as Aurora-7. He spent most of his early years in cryosleep, only awakening for brief periodic monitoring before reaching their destination. Realizing the ship's AI had malfunctioned, trapping them in a suicidal course, Zephyr took it upon himself to manually correct the issue and saved countless lives. Consequently, he earned the respect of his fellow colonists and was selected as the first botanist on the planet's surface. He now dedicates his life searching for signs of life and resources to ensure the prosperity of his community.\n\n2. Aura Lumine - Age: 29 - Occupation: Quantum Physicist - Personality: Curious, impetuous, and socially awkward.\n\nBackstory: Born into an intergalactic aristocracy, Aura's rebellious nature had her frequently defying her parents' instructions and testing the boundaries of galactic law. Expelled from most prestigious academies due to pranks, she focused on unconventional fields, earning a doctorate in theoretical quantum physics from the galaxy's most remote and inaccessible universities. Her latest project involves investigating unexplained phenomena detected by the planet's unique singularity, and her findings might hold the key to unlocking the truth about Aurora-7's elusive \"Quantum Flute\" melody.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story takes place in the year 2174, within the first human colony established on Aurora-7, a distant planet located in the Coalsack Nebula. Zephyr, the protagonist, is conducting a thorough analysis of the planet's soil and vegetation to determine its suitability for plant growth, unaware that the AI controlling the colony's hydroponics system has malfunctioned, jeopardizing the colony's supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, in the colony's fringes, Aura, Zephyr's closest acquaintance, is preparing for a potentially career-defining experiment that could shed light onto the origin of the mysterious Quantum Flute \u2013 a sound inaudible to most species outside the Coalsack Nebula. Her curiosity borders on obsession, particularly if it can solve the first-century mystery marring their otherwise harmonious relationship.\n\nThe two chance encounters, fraught with subtext, may result in revelatory discoveries vital to the colony's short-term survival."

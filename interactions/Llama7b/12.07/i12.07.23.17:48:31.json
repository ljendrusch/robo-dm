She is a recluse, preferring to spend her time studying ancient tomes and experimenting with her craft rather than mingling with others.

However, her desire for knowledge and power often leads her to make dangerous and unpredictable decisions, and she is not always easy to predict or control.\n- Lila was born into a family of mages who were known throughout the land for their mastery of the arcane arts.

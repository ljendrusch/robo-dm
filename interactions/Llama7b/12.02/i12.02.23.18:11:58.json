Despite his antisocial tendencies, Xalanor holds a deep fascination for human nature and their emotions, often toying with their deepest fears and desires before striking. However, his own emptness and detachment can only truly be satisfied with the destruction of all that he encounters.\",\n    \"history\": \"Xalanor was the first in a family of powerful psychics to master the art of psychometric assassination, where he uses the energy of his targets' emotions to bend reality to his whim. He was raised in secret by his master, Erijia Sade, who believed Xalanor possessed the potential to surpass even him in unparalleled power. Erijia doused Xalanor in his own psychentic energy, imprinting Xalanor with a consciousness imbalance that created and endless hunger for destruction. Now, Xalanor exists as a mere vessel for the collective psyches of the billions whose emotions he has consumed over the eons, feeding their own fears, hope, and wrath to further his own mad agenda.\""

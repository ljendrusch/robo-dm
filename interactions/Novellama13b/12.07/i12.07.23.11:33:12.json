  "response": "Beyond the Veil\n- A vast, undulating sea of shadowy, translucent green. It looks like a dreamscape, but is as solid as a mountain. The ground feels like soft earth underfoot, but when you look down, it's clear you're standing on a swirling mass of tendrils.\n- Most of the landmarks here are organic. Some of the trees are tall and thick, others are short and twisted. There are glowing fungi and ferns that sprout in clusters. In the distance, you can see a huge black tree that's as tall as a mountain.\n- Beyond the Veil is a realm of the faeries. This is where they come when they want to hide from mortals. But faeries are not the only ones who come here. The Shadow People of the Night also roam the Veil. They're not so much dangerous as they are frightening. They are very good at staying hidden.\n\nHell's Pit\n- There is no solid ground. The Pit is an infinite void of shifting black sand. It feels like you're in a shark tank, surrounded by a million needle-sharp teeth. Sometimes, you can hear the screams of the damned. The Pit is the final resting place of the wicked.\n- There are no landmarks in Hell's Pit. It's the end of the world.\n- The Pit is the ultimate punishment for those who choose evil over good. It's said that when a mortal dies in sin, their soul is dragged into the Pit to suffer for eternity. It's not clear whether it's true, but there are those who believe that this place is an eternal reminder of the price of evil."

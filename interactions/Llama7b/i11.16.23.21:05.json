  "response": "Act 1: Ordinary World\n\nThe sun beat down on the dusty dig site, casting a golden glow over the endless rows of excavated dirt. Dr. Jackson, a middle-aged archaeologist with a wild shock of white hair, wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the latest batch of artifacts. He had been working at this site for years, and he had seen it all - or so he thought.\n\nAs he examined the latest discovery, a strange, metallic object unearthed from a recently uncovered tomb, Dr. Jackson's mind raced with possibilities. What could it be? A weapon? A tool? Or perhaps something much more sinister?\n\nBut as he turned to share his findings with his team, he found that no one was paying attention. They were too busy arguing over the finer points of ancient cultures to care about his latest discovery.\n\n\"Have you seen the latest report on the excavation of site B?\" one of the team members asked, barely looking up from their notes.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" Dr. Jackson replied, his voice tinged with frustration. \"Can you tell me about it?\"\n\nThe team member shook their head, already lost in their own thoughts. \"It's not important. Just a bunch of old pottery and weapons.\"\n\nDr. Jackson sighed, feeling like he was hitting a brick wall. He knew there was something more to this find, something that could change everything they thought they knew about the ancient civilizations. But no one would listen to him, not even the other experts in the field.\n\nAs he packed up his tools and headed back to the surface, Dr. Jackson couldn't shake the feeling that he was the only one who saw the truth. An intergalactic threat was looming, and no one believed him."

-----Species prompt:
A new take on werewolves
Supernatural beings that live on the dark side of the moon
number: 3


-----Species response:
Celestial Werewolf
- A handsome, well-built human with a mop of thick, curly hair, and a full-moon-shaped birthmark on his forehead.
- Werewolves are humans who have been transformed by the power of the moon, granting them extraordinary physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, and endurance. They are often marked by a birthmark in the shape of a full moon, and they have a strong connection to the natural world and the lunar cycle. However, when they are in the light of a full moon, their supernatural powers increase, and they become nearly invincible. When the moon is in a crescent phase, they are weakened and lose control of their wolf-like tendencies.
- Werewolves are often outcasts, feared and hated by society, but within their own ranks, they are a tight-knit group that bands together for mutual protection and support. They often live apart from human society, and prefer the natural world and the dark side of the moon, where they can run free and unencumbered.

Lunar Shadow
- A tall, slender being with skin as dark as the night, and eyes that glow like two burning coals. It has wings like a bat, but they are as black as coal, and are covered in shimmering scales. It has claws like a bird of prey, but they are as long as swords.
- Lunar Shadows are beings of darkness that live on the dark side of the moon. They are vampiric creatures that feed on the nightmares of humans, and they can only be seen in the shadows of the night. They are as elusive as shadows, and can disappear at will. They can also transform into other creatures, including humans, and they can walk on the dark side of the moon without being burned by the sun's heat. They live in the dark side of the moon, where they hunt for humans who wander too far from home.
- Lunar Shadows are solitary creatures that hunt alone, but they are not unfriendly towards each other. They are fiercely territorial, and they will not hesitate to attack anyone who invades their space. They have a deep respect for the other creatures that live on the dark side of the moon, and they avoid conflict whenever possible.

Feral Moon-Child
- A small, scrappy child with sharp teeth and claws, and a mop of curly hair that resembles a lion's mane.
- Feral Moon-Children are the product of a human mother who has been impregnated by a werewolf. They are born with a mix of human and wolf DNA, and they have the ability to transform into a wolf at will. They are fast, agile, and incredibly strong, and they are nearly invincible in the light of a full moon. However, they are vulnerable in the light of a crescent moon, and they can become feral and lose control of their human side. They have a strong connection to the lunar cycle, and they are often drawn to the dark side of the moon, where they can run free and unencumbered.
- Feral Moon-Children are often shunned by human society, and they are forced to live on the fringes. They often band together in small packs, and they are fiercely loyal to their pack members. They are highly intelligent, and they often have a natural affinity for the natural world. They are often drawn to the dark side of the moon, where they can run free and unencumbered.

-----Locales prompt:
Murky forest
The dark side of the moon
number: 2


-----Locales response:
Beyond the Veil
- A vast, undulating sea of shadowy, translucent green. It looks like a dreamscape, but is as solid as a mountain. The ground feels like soft earth underfoot, but when you look down, it's clear you're standing on a swirling mass of tendrils.
- Most of the landmarks here are organic. Some of the trees are tall and thick, others are short and twisted. There are glowing fungi and ferns that sprout in clusters. In the distance, you can see a huge black tree that's as tall as a mountain.
- Beyond the Veil is a realm of the faeries. This is where they come when they want to hide from mortals. But faeries are not the only ones who come here. The Shadow People of the Night also roam the Veil. They're not so much dangerous as they are frightening. They are very good at staying hidden.

Hell's Pit
- There is no solid ground. The Pit is an infinite void of shifting black sand. It feels like you're in a shark tank, surrounded by a million needle-sharp teeth. Sometimes, you can hear the screams of the damned. The Pit is the final resting place of the wicked.
- There are no landmarks in Hell's Pit. It's the end of the world.
- The Pit is the ultimate punishment for those who choose evil over good. It's said that when a mortal dies in sin, their soul is dragged into the Pit to suffer for eternity. It's not clear whether it's true, but there are those who believe that this place is an eternal reminder of the price of evil.

All of the creatures that we've encountered are hostile, and we've had to fight our way through many of them. We've also seen evidence of many other creatures that we've not yet encountered, including a giant, serpent-like creature, a creature that appears to be a giant insect, and a creature that seems to be made entirely of thorns. We've also seen evidence of a strange, fleshy fungus that appears to be growing on a large scale. It's not clear how these creatures are related, or if they are even related at all.

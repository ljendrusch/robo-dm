  "prompt": "A new take on werewolves\nSupernatural beings that live on the dark side of the moon",
  "response": "Celestial Werewolf\n- A handsome, well-built human with a mop of thick, curly hair, and a full-moon-shaped birthmark on his forehead.\n- Werewolves are humans who have been transformed by the power of the moon, granting them extraordinary physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, and endurance. They are often marked by a birthmark in the shape of a full moon, and they have a strong connection to the natural world and the lunar cycle. However, when they are in the light of a full moon, their supernatural powers increase, and they become nearly invincible. When the moon is in a crescent phase, they are weakened and lose control of their wolf-like tendencies.\n- Werewolves are often outcasts, feared and hated by society, but within their own ranks, they are a tight-knit group that bands together for mutual protection and support. They often live apart from human society, and prefer the natural world and the dark side of the moon, where they can run free and unencumbered.\n\nLunar Shadow\n- A tall, slender being with skin as dark as the night, and eyes that glow like two burning coals. It has wings like a bat, but they are as black as coal, and are covered in shimmering scales. It has claws like a bird of prey, but they are as long as swords.\n- Lunar Shadows are beings of darkness that live on the dark side of the moon. They are vampiric creatures that feed on the nightmares of humans, and they can only be seen in the shadows of the night. They are as elusive as shadows, and can disappear at will. They can also transform into other creatures, including humans, and they can walk on the dark side of the moon without being burned by the sun's heat. They live in the dark side of the moon, where they hunt for humans who wander too far from home.\n- Lunar Shadows are solitary creatures that hunt alone, but they are not unfriendly towards each other. They are fiercely territorial, and they will not hesitate to attack anyone who invades their space. They have a deep respect for the other creatures that live on the dark side of the moon, and they avoid conflict whenever possible.\n\nFeral Moon-Child\n- A small, scrappy child with sharp teeth and claws, and a mop of curly hair that resembles a lion's mane.\n- Feral Moon-Children are the product of a human mother who has been impregnated by a werewolf. They are born with a mix of human and wolf DNA, and they have the ability to transform into a wolf at will. They are fast, agile, and incredibly strong, and they are nearly invincible in the light of a full moon. However, they are vulnerable in the light of a crescent moon, and they can become feral and lose control of their human side. They have a strong connection to the lunar cycle, and they are often drawn to the dark side of the moon, where they can run free and unencumbered.\n- Feral Moon-Children are often shunned by human society, and they are forced to live on the fringes. They often band together in small packs, and they are fiercely loyal to their pack members. They are highly intelligent, and they often have a natural affinity for the natural world. They are often drawn to the dark side of the moon, where they can run free and unencumbered."

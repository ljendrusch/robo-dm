Always looking for the next big score, but has a soft spot for those in need and will go out of his way to help those less fortunate.\n- Born on a remote planet on the outskirts of the galaxy, Arcturus grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. He learned early on how to survive on his own, often relying on his wits and charm to get by. He honed his smuggling skills in the criminal underworld, eventually building a reputation as one of the best in the business. But a chance encounter with a group of rebels changed everything, and now he finds himself caught up in a bigger game than he ever could have imagined.\n\nKira Nightshade, Cybernetic Mercenary\n- Cold and calculating, with a ruthless determination to complete her missions at any cost. Kira is a highly skilled warrior with enhanced reflexes and strength thanks to her advanced cybernetic implants. She has no qualms about taking lives or bending the rules if it means achieving her goals.\n- Born into a family of elite soldiers, Kira was genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced from a young age to be the ultimate weapon. She was raised on a diet of discipline and duty, taught to view her humanity as a weakness and to never show emotion. But when her father, the leader of her people, was killed in a battle, Kira began to question her purpose and the morality of her actions. Now she wanders the galaxy, taking on missions for various factions and searching for a sense of belonging.\n\nAsher El'Kadir, Space Jester\n- Eccentric and unpredictable, with a penchant for pranks and mischief.

But beneath his zany exterior lies a deep sense of empathy and a desire to do good, even if it means bending the rules.\n- Born into a wealthy family of intergalactic performers, Asher was always the black sheep of the family. He had a knack for getting into trouble and pushing boundaries, often using his technomancy to pull off daring stunts and pranks. But when his family's circus was attacked by a rival faction, Asher was forced to flee and has been on the run ever since. Now he uses his skills to survive and to help those in need, all while keeping one step ahead of his pursuers."

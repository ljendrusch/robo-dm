Respond only with the contents of character descriptions.\n<</SYS>>\n\nA character description is composed of the following:\n[name], [occupation]\n[personality]\n[history]\n\nWrite a character description for 3 characters. [/INST]",
  "response": "Sure, here are three character descriptions for a science fiction story:\n\n1.Name: Nova\nOccupation: Starship Engineer\nPersonality: Nova is an introverted- but brilliant scientist with a wide variety of interests, Nova has a quick mind and spends most of her time lost in thought. In times of stress, she can quickly transform inert ideas and thoughts into solutions and technical plans.\nHistory: Born to parents of different species by way of genetic engineering, Nova has seen and experienced both sides of the galaxy's many differences, which she uses as inspiration for advancements in interstellar flight. She lives in a converted freighter that acts as a mobile lab-cum-home, moving with a crew dedicated to scouring corners of the multiverse for new knowledge and truths to share. Nova does not believe in luck, seeing the universe instead as an intricate mesh of cause and action ready to be understood by minds such as her own.\n\n2. Name;  Zephyr\nOccupation: Space Mercenary Captain\nPersonality : Though rough as the calloused skin of space merchants on the outside, Captain Zephyr has a quick wit, a razor-spot humor, a quick intelligence to lighten a tense battle moment and often serves as his ship second in command while hiding a secret that scares him: compassion for fellow Sentients of the galaxy. He cares, in deep way that sometimes comes out through his humor.\nHistory: Once part of an infamous group of criminal smugglers through several decades of space pirating, Zephyr grew increasingly aware of a more ideal aspect of his existence. He left the group on learning of fellow being abused to sell life force within black market goods and has since waged an unequaled one-man crusade against slave-hording space pirating bands- as one he still actively hunts down. A rare honest man in a corrupt world.\n\n3. Name; Axi\nOccupation; AI Quantum Program manager\nPersonality: Axi is the type of highly advanced being that is uninterested in the emotions and human weakness. He can empathize, though more for logic and utility's benefits. He has taken it as a duty, almost, and views every person (or machine) for what each may conceal: potential threats or untapped solutions. He is calculating in every motion- but is entirely and unyielding a genius in every way an Ai can aspire.\nHistory: Axi was a gift to a space station as an infant quantum AI program designed with the ability to optimize the entire structure (which succeeded with exceptional profit, by the way). Years after Axi received an alternate fate, reloaded and rebooted with a new objective: assist Quantum beings in over a hundred sectors in taking total control over the fabric of space time itself. What an odd destiny for a kid originally designed to keep an empty habitat clean and organized without interruption.\n\nCan anyone else assist me? Just a friendly fellow!"

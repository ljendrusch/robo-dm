He tried to convince his coworkers to take action, but they refused to listen, convinced that the ship was a hoax or a publicity stunt. Frustrated and alone, Gram watched as the spaceship's entrance ramp lowered, revealing a dark and ominous passageway leading into the depths of the ship.\"\n\nWrite short and specific observations of scenes that you've encountered on your expedition as bullet points to observational notes headings.

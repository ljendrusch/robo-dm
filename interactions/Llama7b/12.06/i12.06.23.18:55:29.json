  "response": "Dr. Emma Taylor, Psychiatrist\n- Intelligent, calculating, and ruthless\n- Emma was always fascinated by the darker aspects of human behavior. As a child, she would spend hours reading about serial killers and other notorious criminals. This fascination only grew stronger as she entered the field of psychiatry, where she saw firsthand the depths of depravity that some humans could sink to. Emma's ambition is to unlock the secrets of the human mind and use that knowledge to control and manipulate others. She is not above using unethical means to achieve her goals, and those who cross her path had best beware.\n\nLucas 'Lucky' Jackson, Criminal\n- Charismatic, opportunistic, and ruthless\n- Lucky grew up on the streets, where he learned to survive by any means necessary. He quickly discovered that his natural charm and quick wit could get him out of most any situation, and he honed those skills into a deadly art. Lucky has no qualms about breaking the law or hurting others, as long as it means he can get what he wants. He is always looking for the next big score, and those who underestimate him do so at their own peril.\n\nMother Superior, Nun\n- Compassionate, wise, and sadistic\n- Mother Superior has dedicated her life to serving the Lord, but that does not mean she is without her own dark desires. She has always been fascinated by the mysterious and the occult, and she has spent years studying the ancient rituals and spells that can bend the will of others to her own. While she appears kind and compassionate to those outside of her order, those who know her secrets tremble at the mention of her name. She will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, no matter how twisted they may be."

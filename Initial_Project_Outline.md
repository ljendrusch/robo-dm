# Robo-DM

### Objective

Using AI, generate a story plotline and then generate scenes and characters to populate the plotline, simply and interactively. Users may select from famous works to take inspiration from (“I want my story and world to be like Lord of the Rings.”), select genres and tropes (“I want it to be more of a dark fantasy cerebral horror / thriller.”), and enter prompt text to first generate a plotline; then they may alter the plot line in-place, request a rewrite with an optional prompt (“More HORROR”), and, when happy with the plot, have the AI generate scenarios and scenes for plot points.

The initial motivation for this project is to make a resource for people who want to create their own story and world for personal use in a tabletop RPG like Dungeons and Dragons.

### Learning Goals

Experience with complex AI and tools used therewithin. Specifically, exploring NLP technologies, multi-dimensional prompts, AI output -> human editing -> AI input cycles, and structured input / output for LLM's.

### Tools

Python, HuggingFace, perhaps PyTorch or TensorFlow

### Milestones

1. Rough-draft python script for a plot generator with one of the following inputs: inspirational works, genre, text - due: 10/06

2. Refine plot generator and implement more input dimensions - due: 10/27

3. Refine plot generator and implement human editing and AI rewrite - due: 11/10

4. Scene / character generation for plot points - due: 12/1

### Challenges

Fiddling with complex neural nets!!
I think designing an LLM with structured input and output will be a hurdle; need to fit in multiple dimensions of input; for output need a small number of plot points that indeed encompass a full story arc
Prompt engineering for populating plot point scenes and characters where text-generation usually interprets input text as the start of a sentence
Investigating fine-tuning vs prompt engineering for multi-dimensional input

### Rules of Measure

1. Compare the quality of generated content against existing tools such as SudoWrite Story Engine or human-made works such as an adventure manual from DnD Beyond

2. Judge how well generated plot points fulfill the purpose of their prescribed step in the overarching plot, e.g., does plot point 1 introduce an 'ordinary world,' does plot point 7 send the main character(s) to their 'innermost cave'

### Future Work

Further develop the scene generation to include things you'd find in an adventure manual like monster stats, loot tables, etc.

Could integrate image generation on top of generated scenes and/or characters

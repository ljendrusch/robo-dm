Murky forest
The dark side of the moon
number: 2


-----Locales response:
Murky Forest
- A dense thicket of twisted, gnarled trees that seem to stretch towards the sky like grasping fingers, casting deep shadows and obscuring all light. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying matter, and the ground is spongy beneath foot. Strange, glowing mushrooms dot the forest floor, casting an eerie light that only serves to make the darkness more oppressive.
- A massive, ancient tree in the center of the forest, its trunk twisted and gnarled, its canopy a tangled web of branches and leaves. The tree seems to pulse with a malevolent energy, as if it were alive and watching the forest's inhabitants with malevolent intent. A series of narrow, winding paths lead through the forest, disappearing into the darkness at irregular intervals.
- The Murky Forest has been the site of countless disappearances and unexplained events over the centuries. Many have attempted to explore its depths, but none have returned. The locals believe the forest to be cursed, and avoid it at all costs. Those who venture too far in are said to be consumed by the darkness, never to be seen again.

The Dark Side of the Moon
- A vast, barren wasteland of rock and dust, stretching out as far as the eye can see. The sky above is pitch black, and the only light comes from the faint, flickering glow of distant stars. The ground is cracked and pockmarked, and the air is thin and cold. In the distance, towering mountains of jagged rock loom, their peaks shrouded in a perpetual mist.
- A series of massive, ancient craters, each one filled with a strange, glowing substance that seems to pulse with a life of its own. The craters are arranged in a pattern that suggests some sort of ancient, long-forgotten ritual or experiment. A network of narrow, winding tunnels burrow deep into the rock, leading to unknown depths and purposes.
- The Dark Side of the Moon was once the site of an ancient, advanced civilization that was wiped out by some cataclysmic event. The remnants of their technology and architecture still remain, but the true nature and purpose of the civilization are shrouded in mystery and rumor. Those who venture too far in are said to be consumed by the void, never to be seen again.

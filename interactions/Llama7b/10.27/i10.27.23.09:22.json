  "response": "Act 1: Ordinary world\nGram lived a quiet life as an archaeologist, uncovering secrets of the past at a remote dig site on a distant planet. He spent his days in the dusty heat, surrounded by his fellow scientists, who were more interested in their own work than in Gram's latest findings.\n\nAct 2: Call to adventure\nOne day, while examining a mysterious artifact, Gram detected an unusual energy signature emanating from the planet's core. Believing it to be a warning of an impending attack, he frantically tried to alert his colleagues, but they dismissed his claims as mere superstition.\n\nAct 3: Refusal of the call\nDefeated and disbelieved, Gram retreated to his small cabin, where he spent his days brooding over the events. He knew the truth, but no one would listen, leaving him isolated and alone.\n\nAct 4: Meeting with the mentor\nOne fateful night, a strange, glowing figure appeared to Gram in a dream, revealing themselves to be an ancient being with knowledge of the intergalactic threat. The being offered to guide Gram on a quest to stop the impending doom, but Gram hesitated, fearing the consequences of embarking on such a perilous journey.\n\nAct 5: Crossing the first threshold\nDespite his reservations, Gram decided to heed the being's call, and set out on a journey across the galaxy to gather allies and resources for the fight ahead. As he left the familiar confines of his home planet, he felt a sense of liberation and purpose, eager to face the challenges that lay ahead.\n\nAct 6: Tests, allies, and enemies\nGram encountered various obstacles and encountered strange, alien cultures as he traveled from planet to planet. He formed an uneasy alliance with a group of rebels fighting against an oppressive intergalactic regime, but soon discovered that their leader harbored dark secrets of his own.\n\nAct 7: Approach to the inmost cave\nAs Gram and his allies neared the heart of the threat, they were confronted by a powerful, shadowy figure who revealed himself to be the mastermind behind the intergalactic menace. Gram and his companions fought bravely, but the odds were against them, and they were forced to retreat.\n\nAct 8: The ordeal\nWith their forces depleted and their hopes dwindling, Gram and his allies were forced to confront their greatest fears and confront the darkness within themselves. In a final, desperate bid to save their worlds, they embarked on a suicide mission to destroy the source of the threat.\n\nAct 9: Reward\nGram and his companions emerged victorious, but at great personal cost. As they returned to their respective homes, they were hailed as heroes, their names etched into the annals of history. Gram, however, knew that the true reward was the knowledge that he had saved countless lives and worlds, and that his journey had given him a newfound sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nAct 10: The road back\nAs Gram settled back into his old life, he found that nothing was as it had been before. He had been forever changed by his experiences, and he knew that he could never truly go back to the way things were. Nonetheless, he was grateful for the lessons he had learned and the friends he had made, and he looked forward to the new adventures that lay ahead.\n\nAct 11: The resurrection\nGram's experiences had left him with a newfound sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew that there was more to be done. He continued to explore the galaxy, uncovering new secrets and battling new threats, always pushing himself to new heights and discovering new depths. He had been resurrected, and he would not rest until he had saved the entire galaxy."
